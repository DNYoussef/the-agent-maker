## Section 3: Parameter Values

| Parameter | Documentation | Code | Status |
|-----------|---------------|------|--------|
| **Self-modeling temp range** | 0.7-1.3 | 0.7-1.3 | GREEN |
| **Dream consolidation temp** | 1.5-2.0 | 1.5-2.0 | GREEN |
| **Assessment dimensions** | 5 | 5 | GREEN |
| **Curriculum stages** | 7 | 7 | GREEN |
| **W&B metrics** | 7,200+ | 0 | RED |

---

## Section 4: Recommendations

### Critical (Must Fix)
1. **Implement OpenRouter API Client** - Required for frontier model integration
2. **Add Docker Sandbox** - Required for code execution safety
3. **Hook up W&B Integration** - 7,200+ metrics documented but not connected

### Important (Should Fix)
1. **Replace simulated assessment** with real model evaluation
2. **Implement TRM architecture reuse** from Phase 1
3. **Add real training loop validation**

### Nice to Have
1. Full Eudaimonia system implementation
2. Advanced curriculum adaptation
3. Cross-phase memory persistence

## Section 5: Conclusion

| Aspect | Score | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Documentation | 95% | Excellent - 28,695 words |
| Code Structure | 80% | Good - clean architecture |
| Feature Implementation | 45% | Partial - skeletons only |
| Paper Alignment | 85% | Good - concepts integrated |
| **Overall** | **70%** | **Specification Complete, Implementation Partial** |

**Estimated Completion**: 6-8 weeks additional work, $600-800 API costs
